### 1.a

> A 2's complement signed integer?

Negative binary; flip the bits and add one:

`1010 1101 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010`

`0101 0010 1110 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101`

`0101 0010 1110 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110`

= -1,391,460,350

### 1.b

> A MIPS instruction?

- Op code (first 6 bits): `1010 11`
  	- Not 0, so not R-type instruction
  	- Equal to `0x2B` => store word instruction (`sw`)
- `sw rt imm(rs)`
	- Format: `0x2B rs rt imm`
	- 5-bit `rs=01 000` = 8, $8, or $t0 (source)
	- 5-bit `rt=1 0000` = 16, $16, or $s0 (destination)
	- 16-bit `imm=0000 0000 0000 0010`  = 2
- `sw $16 2($8)` or `sw $s0 2($t0)`
- Means that `MEM[$8+2] = $16` or `MEM[$t0+2] = $s0`

## 2

> Determine the absolute value of a signed integer. Show the implementation of the following pseudo-instruction using three real instructions:
>
> `abs $t1, $t2`

```asm
sra $t1, $t2, 31
xor $t2, $t2, $t1
subu $t1, $t2, $t1
```

## 3

> For each pseudo-instruction in the following table, produce a minimal sequence of actual MIPS instructions to accomplish the same thing. You may use the `$at` for some of the sequences. In the following table, `imm32` refers to a 32-bit constant.

### 3.a

> `move $t1, $t2`

```asm
addu $t1, $zero, $t2
```

### 3.b

> `clear $t5`

```asm
and $t5, $t5, $zero
```

### 3.c

> `li $t5, imm32`

```asm
addiu $t5, $zero, imm32
```

### 3.d

> `addi $t5, $t3, imm32`

```asm
addi $t0, $zero, 0xFFFF		# create mask
andi $t1, $t0, imm32		# get bottom bits using mask
xori $t2, $t1, imm32		# get top bits by filtering out bottom bits
or $t5, $t1, $t2			# combine into t5
add $t5, $t3, $t5			# add $t3
```

### 3.e

> `beq $t5, imm32, Label`

```asm
addi $t0, $zero, 0xFFFF		# create mask
andi $t1, $t0, imm32		# get bottom bits using mask
xori $t2, $t1, imm32		# get top bits by filtering out bottom bits
or $t3, $t1, $t2			# combine into t3
beq $t5, $t3, Label
```

### 3.f

> `ble $t5, $t3, Label`

```asm
slt $t0, $t3, $t5		# inverse of $t5 <= $t3, $t5 > $t3
beq $t0, $zero, Label	# branch if not $t5 > $t3
```

### 3.g

> `bgt $t5, $t3, Label`

```asm
slt $t0, $t3, $t5		# $t5 > $t3
bne $t0, $zero, Label	# branch if $t5 > $t3
```

### 3.h

> `bge $t5, $t3, Label`

```asm
slt $t0, $t5, $t3		# $t5 < $t3
beq $t0, $zero, Label	# branch if $t5 >= $t3
```

## 4

> Translate the following statements into MIPS assembly language. Assume that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are allocated in `$s0`, `$s1`, `$s2`, and `$s3`. All values are signed 32-bit integers.

### 4.a

> `if ((a > b) || (b > c)) {d = 1;}`

```asm
slt $t0, $s1, $s0		# b < a
slt $t1, $s2, $s1		# c < b
or $t2, $t0, $t1		# (a > b) || (b > c)
bne $t2, $zero, set_d
j end

set_d: addi $s3, $zero, 1

end:
```

### 4.b

> `if ((a <= b) && (b > c)) {d = 1;}`

```asm
slt $t0, $s1, $s0		# a > b
xori $t0, $t0, 1		# flip to find a <= b
slt $t1, $s2, $s1		# c < b
and $t2, $t0, $t1		# (a <= b) && (b > c)
bne $t2, $zero, set_d
j end

set_d: addi, $s3, $zero, 1

end:
```

## 5

> Consider the following fragment of C code:
>
> `for (i=0; i<=100; i=i+1) { a[i] = b[i] + c; }`
>
> Assume that `a` and `b` are arrays of words and the base address of `a` is in `$a0` and the base address of `b` is in `$a1`. Register `$t0` is associated with variable `i` and register `$s0` with `c`. Write the code in MIPS.

```asm
addiu $t5, $zero, 100
L1:
	lw $t1, 0($a1)		# $t1 = b[i]
	addu $t2, $t1, $s0	# $t2 = b[i] + c
	sw $t2, 0($a0)		# a[i] = $t2
	addiu $a0, $a0, 4	# point to next a[i]
	addiu $a1, $a1, 4	# point to next b[i]
	addiu $t0, $t0, 1	# i += 1
	slt $t3, $t5, $t0	# $t3 = i > 100
	beq $t3, $zero, L1	# loop if (i <= 100)
```

## 6

> Add comments to the following MIPS code and describe in one sentence what it computes. Assume that `$a0` is used for the input and initially contains `n`, a positive integer. Assume that `$v0` is used for the output.

```asm
begin:
	addi $t0, $zero, 0		# $t0 = 0
	addi $t1, $zero, 1		# t1 = 1
loop:
	slt $t2, $a0, $t1		# $t2 = n < $t1
	bne $t2, $zero, finish	# finish if n < $t1
	add $t0, $t0, $t1		# if input >= $t1, $t0 += $t1
	addi $t1, $t1, 2		# $t1 += 2
	j loop					# repeat
finish:
	add $v0, $t0, $zero		# $v0 = $t0
```

**The code produces the square number sequence, with each square outputted twice.**

## 7

> The following code fragment processes an array and produces two important values in registers `$v0` and `$v1`. Assume that the array consists of 5000 words indexed 0 through 4999, and its base address is stored in `$a0` and its size (5000) in `$a1`. Describe what this code does. Specifically, what will be returned in `$v0` and `$v1`?

```asm
add $a1, $a1, $a1
add $a1, $a1, $a1			# ... $a1 *= 4 === 20,000
add $v0, $zero, $zero		# $v0 = 0
add $t0, $zero, $zero		# $t0 = 0
outer:
	add $t4, $a0, $t0
	lw $t4, 0($t4)			# $t4 = $a0[$t0]
	add $t5, $zero, $zero	# $t5 = 0
	add $t1, $zero, $zero	# $t1 = 0
inner:
	add $t3, $a0, $t1
	lw $t3, 0($t3)			# $t3 = $a0[$t1]
	bne $t3, $t4, skip
	addi $t5, $t5, 1		# if $t3 == $t4: increment $t5
skip:
	addi $t1, $t1, 4
	bne $t1, $a1, inner		# point $t1 to next index while it's less than $a1
	slt $t2, $t5, $v0
	bne $t2, $zero, next	# if $t5 < $v0: next
	add $v0, $t5, $zero		# $v0 = $t5
	add $v1, $t4, $zero		# $v1 = $t4
next:
	addi $t0, $t0, 4		# point $t0 to next index
	bne $t0, $a1, outer		# break if $t0 < $a1
```

**The loop finds the highest occurring element in the array (`$v1`), and keeps count of its occurrences (`$v0`).**
