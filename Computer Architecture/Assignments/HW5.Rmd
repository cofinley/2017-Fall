## 1

> Describe the effect that a single stuck-at-0 fault (i.e., the signal is always 0 regardless of what it should be) would have for the signals shown below, in the single-cycle Datapath. Which instructions, if any, will not work correctly? Explain why.
Consider each of the following faults separately:

### 1.a

> RegWrite = 0

Nothing can be written to registers if RegWrite=0. This will render R-type instructions that handle arithmetic or loading useless. Storing or branching can still function, though.

### 1.b

> RegDst = 0

This means that R-type instructions will not have the right destination register to write to and won't work.

### 1.c

> ALUSrc = 0

This means that ALU won't be able to receive the correct sign-extended bits which means I-type instructions won't work. Branching still works, though.

### 1.d

> MemtoReg = 0

Loading from memory to registers function correctly.

### 1.e

> Branch = 0

Branching will flip in terms of logic. Branches will happen if the conditions are false, but not true. This essentially flips the expected result.


## 2

> Repeat question 1 but this time consider stuck-at-1 faults (the signal is always 1)

### 2.a

> RegWrite = 1

Registers can and will be written to for all instructions. Contrary to RegWrite=0, storing and branching will not work, but other R-type instructions will.

### 2.b

> RegDst = 1

Loading will have an incorrect destination.

### 2.c

> ALUSrc = 1

The ALU won't receive the register read for the second register which means R-type instructions won't function correctly.

### 2.d

> MemtoReg = 1

R-type instructions will input bad info into registers.

### 2.e

> Branch = 1

If the ALU outputs 0, the PC will get an incorrect address. Contrary to Branch=0, branching will function expectedly here.

## 3

> We wish to add the instruction `jalr` (jump and link register) to the single-cycle datapath. Add any necessary datapath and control signals and draw the result datapath. Show the values of the control signals to control the execution of the `jalr` instruction. 
The jump and link register instruction is described below:
`jalr rd, rs # rd = pc + 4 , pc = rs`

> Suppose we add the multiply and divide instructions. The operation times are as follows:
- Instruction memory access time = 190 ps,      
- Data memory access time = 190 ps,
- Register file read access time = 150 ps, 
- Register file write access = 150 ps
- ALU delay for basic instructions = 190 ps,      
- ALU delay for multiply or divide = 550 ps
Ignore the other delays in the multiplexers, control unit, sign-extension, etc.
Assume the following instruction mix: 30% ALU, 15% multiply & divide, 20% load, 10% store, 15% branch, and 10% jump.

### 4.a

> What is the total delay for each instruction class and the clock cycle for the single-cycle CPU design?
