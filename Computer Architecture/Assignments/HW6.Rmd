## 1

> Describe the effect that a single stuck-at-0 fault (i.e., the signal is always 0 regardless of what it should be) would have for the signals shown below, in the single-cycle Datapath. Which instructions, if any, will not work correctly? Explain why.
> Consider each of the following faults separately:

### 1.a

> RegWrite = 0

Nothing can be written to registers if RegWrite=0. This will render R-type instructions that handle arithmetic or loading useless. Storing or branching can still function, though.

### 1.b

> RegDst = 0

This means that R-type instructions will not have the right destination register to write to and won't work.

### 1.c

> ALUSrc = 0

This means that ALU won't be able to receive the correct sign-extended bits which means I-type instructions won't work. Branching still works, though.

### 1.d

> MemtoReg = 0

Loading from memory to registers function correctly.

### 1.e

> Branch = 0

Branching will flip in terms of logic. Branches will happen if the conditions are false, but not true. This essentially flips the expected result.


## 2

> Repeat question 1 but this time consider stuck-at-1 faults (the signal is always 1)

### 2.a

> RegWrite = 1

Registers can and will be written to for all instructions. Contrary to RegWrite=0, storing and branching will not work, but other R-type instructions will.

### 2.b

> RegDst = 1

Loading will have an incorrect destination.

### 2.c

> ALUSrc = 1

The ALU won't receive the register read for the second register which means R-type instructions won't function correctly.

### 2.d

> MemtoReg = 1

R-type instructions will input bad info into registers.

### 2.e

> Branch = 1

If the ALU outputs 0, the PC will get an incorrect address. Contrary to Branch=0, branching will function expectedly here.

## 3

> We wish to add the instruction `jalr` (jump and link register) to the single-cycle datapath. Add any necessary datapath and control signals and draw the result datapath. Show the values of the control signals to control the execution of the `jalr` instruction. 
> The jump and link register instruction is described below:
> `jalr rd, rs # rd = pc + 4 , pc = rs`

This is like an R-type instruction, where Rd = 1, RegWrite = 1, Rt = 0, and there is no memory reading or writing.


## 4

> Suppose we add the multiply and divide instructions. The operation times are as follows:

> - Instruction memory access time = 190 ps,      
>
> - Data memory access time = 190 ps,
>
> - Register file read access time = 150 ps, 
>
> - Register file write access = 150 ps
>
> - ALU delay for basic instructions = 190 ps,
>
> - ALU delay for multiply or divide = 550 ps
>
> Ignore the other delays in the multiplexers, control unit, sign-extension, etc.

> Assume the following instruction mix:

### 4.a

> What is the total delay for each instruction class and the clock cycle for the single-cycle CPU design?

**Worst case: 1040 ps = clock cycle**



### 4.b

> Assume we fix the clock cycle to 200 ps for a multi-cycle CPU, what is the CPI for each instruction class and the speedup over a fixed-length clock cycle?

- ALU: 680 ps / 200 ps = 3.4 => 4 cycles per instruction (rounded up) 
- Mult. & Div.: 1040 / 200 = 5.2 => 6 cycles per instruction
- Load: 870 ps / 200 ps = 4.35 => 5 cycles per instruction
- Store: 720 ps / 200 ps = 3.6 => 4 cycles per instruction
- Branch: 530 ps / 200 ps = 2.65 => 3 cycles per instruction
- Jump: 340 ps / 200 ps = 1.7 => 2 cycles per instruction

CPI (avg.): (0.3 * 4) + (0.15 * 6) + (0.2 * 5) + (0.1 * 4) + (0.15 * 3) + (0.1 * 2) = 4.15 CPI

Speedup:

- Speedup = CPU time A / CPU time B
- CPU time = Instruction count * CPI * Clock cycle time (chapter 1, page 36)
  -  Instruction count can be left out since they are the same in both parts

Part A:

- CPI = 1
  - Part A was a single-cycle CPU, meaning one clock cycle per instruction
- Clock cycle time = 1040 ps
- CPU time = 1 * 1040 ps = 1040 ps

Part B:

- CPI = 4.15 (average)
- Clock cycle time: 200 ps
- CPU time = 4.15 * 200 ps = 830 ps

**Speedup: 1040 ps / 830 ps = 1.25**
