Had to redo a few things after finding the problem with fewest links.

path_links (linked list) is needed rather than path (list)
	keeps most efficient path from target in mind
	path just builds off the wrong information
		heuristics/cost were building off path as well

I think read_city is still needed for input validation.

I like the idea of excluding cities from the beginning, however the code changes were a little verbose. Will take a look at later.
