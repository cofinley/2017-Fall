The program starts in run.py, which contains functions specific to the user input. 
It also calls upon search.py, which contains all the code pertaining to the A* algorithm.
The file tests.py contains code to bypass the console input and quickly test different values.

To quickly run the precompiled program:

	- Click on `run.exe`

To compile and run:

	- Run `python run.py` in the console/terminal

To quickly test:

	1. Edit `tests.py`
		- Change variables, save changes, and exit
	2. `python tests.py` in the console/terminal

Usage details:

	- Connection and location text file paths can have spaces in them since Python casts the input to a string. No escaping or quotes needed.
