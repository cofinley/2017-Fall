OS Exam 2 Questions

- Deadlocks
  - Necessary conditions
    - Cycle present and only one instance of resource type
  - Resource-Allocation Graph
  - Avoidance
  - Prevention
  - Banker's
  - Detection
  - Wait-for graph
  - Recovery
    - Choose one victim, suspend its resources, check again for deadlock
      - If deadlock still, choose second victim
    - Disadvantage: starvation of processes

- Main memory
  - Address binding
  - Logical/physical space
  - Allocation
    - Dynamic storage alloc
    - Strategies of selecting free space
  - Paging system
    - MEthod of implementation
    - EAT
      - If miss: two mem access + access time to TLB
    - Memory protection in paging system
    - Diff. strucutres of page table
      - Hierachical (multilevel)
      - Inverted
      - Disadvantages
    - Segmentation
      - Protection
    - Fragmentation
    - Advantages of paging and segmentation
      - Sharing/protection easier in segmentation system

- Virtual Memory
  - Benefits
  - Demand paging
  - Steps to handle page fault
  - EAT
  - Copy-on-write
    - Child process involved
  - Page replacement methods
  - Second change algo
  - Allocations of frames
  - Alloc algos
  - Global vs. local replacement
    - Global: choose victim from any process
    - Local: choose victim that's making new reference in a specific process (helps with thrashing)
  - Thrashing
  - Working set model
  - Prepaging
  - Page size implications (on fragmentation, page table size, etc.)
  - Program structure
