# OS - Memory

> 2017/10/10

## Background

- CPU can access main mem or regs directly
	- Regs are one operation
	- Main memory can take multiple operations, causing a *stall*

## Address Binding

- ...

## Logical vs. Physical Address Space

- Logical: generated by CPU (aka virtual)
- ...

## Memory Management Unit (MMU)

- HW devices that maps virtual to physical addresses at runtime
- User program deals with logical, it never sees the real physical address
- ...

## Dynamic Relocation

- ...

## Dynamic Linking

- **Static linking**: system libs and code combined by loader into binary
- Dynamic linking: ...

## Swapping

- Needed because some processes take up too much memory and cannot make room for another process and its memory
- Process can be swapped temporarily out of mem to a backing store, then brought back into mem for continued execution
- ...
- Normally disabled in OS's until more memory needs to be allocated
- ...

### Context Switch Time with Swapping

- If next proc to go to CPU is not in mem, need to swap out process and swap in target
- Context switch time can then be high
- Example:
- 100MB process swapping to hard disk with transfer rate of 50MB/sec
	- Swap out time of 2000 ms
	- ...
